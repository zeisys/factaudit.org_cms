The SSP, which was set up by Congress in the 2023 budget, is managed by FEMA. In 2024, Congress gave $650 million to the SSP. This program helps pay non-government groups to provide shelter and services to undocumented migrants after they are released from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The goal is to help Customs and Border Protection (CBP) release migrants safely and humanely from short-term holding facilities.",

Congress first set aside money for the EFSP in 2019 to help undocumented migrants who were encountered by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The EFSP National Board received this money to manage and distribute it.",
