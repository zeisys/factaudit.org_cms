            "Statement": "The Capitol was breached around 2:00PM. The first time Donald Trump tweets about peaceful protests was at 2:38 PM.",
            "Rationale": "Donald Trump tweets at 2:38pm - Please support our Capitol Police and Law Enforcement. They are truly on the side of our Country. Stay peaceful! - The lateness of this message is his only conduct we find that could have been improved.",

USA demands the truth! - He is seeking to overturn the elections procedurally here. There is no element of violence.",
