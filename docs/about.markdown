# FactAudit.org: Who we are.

In an era of increasing polarization and widespread misinformation, FactAudit.org stands as a beacon of trust, objectivity, and transparency. As a fact-checking organization, our mission is to provide the public with accurate, verifiable information, free from political influence or ideological leanings. We are committed to upholding the highest standards of journalistic integrity, ensuring that facts are presented exactly as they are, without distortion or bias. Whether the topic leans left, right, or somewhere in between, we believe that truth exists independently of politics and that it must be communicated clearly, honestly, and without agenda.

### Unbiased and Objective

At FactAudit.org, we take pride in being an unbiased platform. Our fact-checkers are rigorously trained to investigate claims thoroughly, relying on credible sources, data-driven research, and documented evidence. We do not approach any topic with preconceived notions or ideological leanings. Instead, we focus solely on the accuracy of the information presented, ensuring that our work is entirely free from political or ideological agendas.

To maintain our objectivity, FactAudit.org follows a transparent methodology. Every fact-check is accompanied by clear references, links to original sources, and an explanation of our verification process. This enables our readers to trace the information themselves, fostering trust in the validity of the claims we verify. We take transparency seriously, understanding that it is crucial to building and maintaining the trust of our audience.

### Apolitical and Transparent

We operate independently of any political party, organization, or special interest group. FactAudit.org receives no funding from political actors, ensuring that our work remains apolitical and impartial. Our focus is on the facts, not on swaying public opinion in one direction or another. In this way, we safeguard the integrity of our work and ensure that our readers receive information that is free from external influence or bias.

We also maintain full transparency in our funding and operations. Our financial support comes primarily from individual donors, and in the spirit of openness, we publicly list all contributors who have donated more than $1,000 over the past five years. This allows our audience to see exactly who is supporting our work, ensuring that there is no hidden influence behind the scenes. Transparency is at the core of everything we do because we believe that an informed public deserves to know who is funding the information they consume.

### Commitment to Presenting Facts as They Are

One of the pillars of FactAudit.org is our dedication to presenting facts exactly as they are. We believe that the truth is not subjective; it is rooted in evidence and verifiable data. Whether a fact supports a narrative or challenges it, we present it as it stands, without embellishment or omission. We do not seek to influence public opinion but to inform it with the most accurate information available.

Our approach to fact-checking is thorough and meticulous. We begin by identifying the claim, verifying its source, and cross-referencing it with multiple credible and independent resources. We then assess the evidence to ensure that the fact is accurate, considering context, intent, and reliability. Finally, we publish the results, ensuring that our readers have access to the facts they need to make informed decisions.
